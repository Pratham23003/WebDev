# Web Development Progress ðŸš€  

This repository contains my daily progress as I learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

## ðŸ“… Progress Tracker  
- **Day 1:** Learned about HTML structure, tags, elements, attributes, div, id, class, and basic navigation bars.  
- **Day 2:** Learned about **HTML tables**, practiced `rowspan` & `colspan`, recreated some tables, and explored **HTML forms** (input fields, buttons, dropdowns).
- **Day 3 & 4:** Couldn't do much (Assignments and stuff...)
- **Day 5:** Created multiple forms, created two small projects - a Portfolio & a Product Catalogue
- **Day 6:** Explored media in HTML (audio, video, GIFs, iframes), added a favicon, played around with autoplay, and wrapped up HTML with a final brainrot project.
- **Day 7:** Started learning **CSS**, covered selectors, cascading, style sheets, and the three ways to apply CSS (inline, internal, and external).
